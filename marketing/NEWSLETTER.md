**Body:**

Hi [Name],

**This Week's Profit Tip:**

Most AFH owners use monthly rates. Smart owners use daily rates.

**Why?** You get paid for the 31st day of the month.

**The Formula:**
```
(Monthly Rate × 12) ÷ 365 = Daily Rate
```

**Example:**
- Monthly Rate: $8,500
- Daily Rate: ($8,500 × 12) ÷ 365 = $279.45/day
- Extra Revenue: $8,500/year per resident

**For a 6-bed home:** That's $51,000 additional annual revenue!

**How to Implement:**
1. Calculate daily rate for each resident
2. Update your billing system
3. Communicate change to families (30-day notice required)
4. Start billing daily

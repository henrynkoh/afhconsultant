## Ad Set 2: Educational (Single Image)

### Headline
**The #1 Reason AFH Owners Fail (And How to Avoid It)**

### Primary Text
It's not lack of care. It's lack of financial strategy.

Most AFH owners jump in with passion but no business plan. They accept low-paying Medicaid residents, work 24/7, and barely break even.

**The Solution?** Learn to:
• Select high-wealth locations
• Attract private-pay residents ($8,500-$12,000/month)
• Implement tiered pricing models
• Pass state surveys with zero deficiencies

Join our comprehensive curriculum designed for consultants who want to help owners build profitable, sustainable AFH businesses.

### Post 1: Problem Hook

**Text:**
Most AFH owners I work with are making the same mistake: they're working 24/7 but barely breaking even.

Here's why:
• Accepting low-paying Medicaid residents ($4K/month)
• No strategy for private-pay marketing
• Flat-rate pricing instead of tiered
• Missing compliance requirements

The result? Exhausted owners, thin margins, and high burnout rates.

But it doesn't have to be this way.

Our curriculum teaches consultants to help owners:
✅ Select high-wealth locations
✅ Attract $8,500-$12,000/month private-pay residents
✅ Implement tiered pricing models
✅ Pass state surveys with zero deficiencies

The difference? One owner went from $30K to $55K monthly revenue in 6 months.

### Post 2: Educational Thread

**Text:**
🧵 The 3 Pillars of AFH Financial Success (A Thread)

1/7 **Pillar 1: Financial Engineering**
Most owners use flat-rate pricing. Big mistake.

Tiered pricing based on acuity level:
• Level 1 (Basic): $7,500/month
• Level 2 (Moderate): $9,500/month
• Level 3 (High): $11,500/month
• Level 4 (Intensive/Hospice): $13,500/month

This alone can add $15K-$30K annual revenue per resident.

2/7 **Pillar 2: Medication System Integrity**
WAC 388-76-10430 requires a "strong medication system."

Common violations:
• Ditto marks on MAR
• Missing signature keys
• Improper narcotic storage

One citation = potential license suspension.

3/7 **Pillar 3: Resident Rights Compliance**
WAC 388-10510+ mandates complete disclosure packets.

Missing disclosures = immediate citations.

4/7 **The Solution?**
Our curriculum teaches consultants to:
• Audit financial systems
• Implement compliance protocols
• Protect owner licenses
• Maximize revenue

5/7 **Real Results:**
Owner A: $30K → $55K monthly revenue
Owner B: 100% Medicaid → 80% Private Pay
Owner C: Zero deficiencies on state survey

### Post 4: Quick Tip

**Text:**
💡 Quick Tip: The Daily Rate Formula

Most AFH owners use monthly rates. Smart owners use daily rates.

Why? You get paid for the 31st day of the month.

Formula:
(Monthly Rate × 12) ÷ 365 = Daily Rate

Example:
$8,500/month = $279.45/day

Over a year, that's an extra $8,500 in revenue.
